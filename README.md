# Early state model – Designkonzeption

### Dokumentation zur Weboberfläche

Diese Dokumentation dient der Vorstellung der, zum gegenwertigen Zeitpunkt realisierten, Weboberfläche zu meiner Diplomarbeit: "Design of a Digital Assistant for 
Pre-Consultation for Country-Specific Travel Medicine". 

Im ersten Teil wurde ein 
Designvorschlag eines Reisemedizinischen Chatbots auf Basis einer Literaturrecherche und Experteninterviews durchgeführt. Im zweiten Teil wurde
anhand von zufälligen Probanden der Chatbot (ohne weitere Komponenten der finalen Weboberfläche) getestet und der 
Gesprächsleitfaden sowie die Designvorschläge evaluiert. Im letzten Teil wird der Chatbot auf einer webbasierten Oberfläche für 
den prototypisch Betrieb zur Verfügung gestellt.

### Abstract Diploma Thesis

In recent years, researchers have expressed increasing interest in conversational agents. This is partially 
due to advances in computer-based systems’ ability to adapt natural language and user-friendly 
possibilities to develop and implement digital assistants for specific applications. Especially in terms of
patient care in the medical field, scholars have discussed creating a self-service option in e-health 
systems. Patients can use the self-service option to independently report personal issues, ask questions,
or obtain information on medical matters. This paper presents design science research which aims to 
develop a digital assistant to increase the knowledge patients receive prior to consultation within the 
travel medical field. It accomplishes this by applying a dialog to first provide a step-by-step
informational guide. By identifying gaps in knowledge and providing further suggestions, the aim is to 
prepare a user for topics in the travel medical scope. For this purpose, a literature review was performed 
and expert interviews conducted, revealing the state of the current research area and defining a 
knowledge scope. Meta-requirements and design principles were derived to inform the design concept 
of a digital assistant under consideration of the cooperative principles, the social response theory, and 
trust factors for automation. An online experiment measured perception on different designed digital 
assistants following the design principles found in comparison to a control group based on the same 
knowledge. The examination of 189 participants revealed that perceived social presence led to 
significantly higher interpersonal trust in the digital assistant and significantly increased their 
perception of the overall trust in human-automation as well as service satisfaction. Furthermore, it 
found that social presence was reduced in particular by a non-personalized consultation service, which 
occurred due to the limited scope of knowledge. Thus, this study contributed by illustrating the impact 
of social cues on user perception through the established design principles.
